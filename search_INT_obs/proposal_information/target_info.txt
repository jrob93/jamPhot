23 unique nights of data from March 2022 - March 2023
39 unique targets (asteroids and comets)

The data comes from a number of proposals by the Edinburgh Comets and Asteroids research group to characterise lightcurves of asteroids and inactive comet nuclei (WFC) and also to get spectroscopic observations of comets (IDS).

Skybot results - 1764 known SSOs across the WFC observing blocks
150 of these are asteroids with V < 20 (only 16 of these asteroids have a period in LCDB)
